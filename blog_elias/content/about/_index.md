Hi ! I am Elias Ramzi I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at the Cnam in the Vertigo team. I graduated from CentraleSupelec (engineering degree) with a major in computer science and machine learning.
I started my PhD in the Cnam in January 2021 under the supervision of [Nicolas Thome][1]. My PhD if co-funded by [Coexya][2] which develops intellectual property softwares, including a trademark logo search engine.
I am working in the field of Content Based Image Retrieval using Deep Learning models.
